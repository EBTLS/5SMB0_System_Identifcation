# Mini-Assignment

In the mini-assignment, we are assigned to a MATLAB `.p` in which contains a system with an Butterworth pre-filter, an magnitude unknown Saturation part, an unknown noise filter. In the assignment, we should try to **identify the system transfer function, the magnitude of the saturation part and the property of the noise filter.**

 This assignment contains the following several parts:

1. Specify the property of the given Butterworth filter and identify the magnitude of the saturation part
2. Identified an ETFE model and estimate the noise spectrum
3. Design appropriate input and do standard parametric identification and validate
4. Identify with OE model and try different starting point
5. Identify with an BJ model
